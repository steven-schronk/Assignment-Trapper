Assignment Trapper

Web software for teaching students to program.

Students post programs to the web and are graded accordingly.

Students can request help as needed.

A workflow is setup between the student and the instructor. Keeping track of classes and students is easy.

RSS feeds and e-mail provide almost instant feedback for students on their progress.

Faculty to comment directly line-by-line on student source code that is turned in.

Assignments open and close on a set schedule to prevent faculty overload of late assignments at end of semester.

NOTE: THE BLESSED VERSION OF THIS PROJECT IS AT GITHUB.
